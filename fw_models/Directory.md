# FUNWAVE Model Runs
This directory is cleaned as of 30 January 2025.

## Dune 3 Based Models
The Dune3 dataset, as collected at Oregon State University, is used as the data source for this suite of model runs. It includes data from a large experimental flume over the span of ~1400 seconds for 20 Trials

### `Dune3_Validation`
This suite was developed to validate the Dune3 flume experiment as run in FUNWAVE-TVD against experimental data. Some sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine what the optimal wavemaker, sponge, and numerical parameters are to make this work.

## FRF Based Models
### `FRF_Bathymetry`
This suite is designed to investigate how different FRF bathymetry can be leveraged in FUNWAVE-TVD simulations, under relatively simple wave forcing conditions.

### `FRF_Spectra`
This suite is designed to investigate how different FRF spectra can be leveraged in FUNWAVE-TVD simulations, under relatively simple/small sets of bathymetries.
